# Ongoing personal project of an application (Outfit Of The Day) that reads data from a weather API and picks out an outfit from my closet that is suited for the current weather.

Current base architecture that I will be using for my application. If this was a production setting I would be using Multi-AZ mode for RDS, but due to it being a personal project & tight budget, I will be creating a version not using Multi-AZ mode because of the high costs.
